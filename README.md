Telecommunication industry analysis
In an era where communication is the lifeblood of our interconnected world, the telecom industry stands at the forefront of enabling seamless connections. As the global population grows, the demand for instant and reliable communication has increased, paving the way for a dynamic and ever-evolving telecommunications sector. 

AccredianTelecom, one of the leading telecom players, understands that customizing offerings is very important for its business to stay competitive.

AccredianTelecom Company has collected active data of 50 million devices from more than 60% of the users, over all the states of India.

The data is about user's calls for various events from different geolocations. The category of users is segregated over their gender, age, age groups, and the phone brand, device model used by them.

The purpose of collecting such a data is to guide companyâ€™s clients to understand the behavioural aspects of users, about their phone brand choices, and pursue data-driven marketing efforts.

While this vast dataset presents significant opportunities, it also poses a challenge in harnessing its full potential to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving telecommunications market.

The problem at hand is to leverage this extensive data resource effectively, enabling our telecom company to make informed strategic decisions and capitalize on emerging opportunities while maintaining a competitive edge.

As a consultant, I have built a dashboard which will help company to understand a user's demographic characteristics based on their mobile usage, geolocation, and mobile device properties.

To help the customer the consultants are expected to have in depth of clarity in the underlying data. Consultants should help the company understand what is the right way forward and suggest actionable insights from marketing and product terms.
